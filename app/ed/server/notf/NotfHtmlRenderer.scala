/**
 * Generates HTML for email notifications, e.g. "You have a reply" or
 * "Your comment was approved".
 *
 * 1. Include only one link per notification? Otherwise people will (I guess)
 * not click the link to the actual reply. I'd guess they instead would
 * click the visually *largest* link, e.g. to the page (which would be larger,
 * because the page title is usually fairly long), and then not find
 * the new reply, and feel annoyed. (The new-reply-link highlights
 * the reply, but the page link doest not.)
 *
 * 2. For now, don't bother about the redirect from "/-pageId#..."
 * to the actual page path.
 *
 * COULD remove columns from DW1_NOTFS_PAGE_ACTIONS because now I'm
 * loading the page + comment from here anyway!
